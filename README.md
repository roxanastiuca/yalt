# YALT - Uninvasive Collection of Supercomputer Usage Data

This is the main repository for YALT. It has the following structure:
- opentracer: source code for our data collection tool;
- database_of_knowledge: bash and Python scripts for building a database of knowledge about software packages;
- job_labelling: scripts to detect packages in cluster jobs data and to label jobs based on the data collected and extracted.

## Project Purpose

This was developed as part of my Master Thesis at ETH Zurich on the topic of "Uninvasive Collection of Supercomputer Usage Data".

## Contributions

The development was mostly driven by having a working prototype, and not on delivering the best-quality code, but I am open to improve this code base. You can contact me regarding clarifications, and are free to add issues and comments, or to create pull requests.
